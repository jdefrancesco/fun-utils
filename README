These are three short fun little programs I wrote back when I was
in high school. They include:

me.c - This is the classical /me command from IRC ported to your shell when you want
to express some of those feelings inside!

piano.pl - A simple little command line piano using system beeps. Written in PERL.

penistime.c - me and an old friend hacked around and made this back in the day (i.e in 8th or 9th grade, was young, don't judge ;-\) 
as a joke.. (RIP Dlab)
