These are three short fun little programs I wrote back when I was
in high school. They include:

penistime.c - Utility that displays your uptime and a ASCII penis with a length corresponding
to how long your computer has been running.

me.c - This is the classical /me command from IRC ported to your shell when you want
to express some of those feelings inside!

piano.pl - A simple little command line piano using system beeps. Written in PERL.
